# About

This is a very small snippet from a personal project I have been working on, and is based on [A Million Times Clock](https://www.humanssince1982.com/a-million-times). This was created with `create-react-app` and built using node `v12.18.2`. As this is still a work in progress, it is not fully responsive yet, but I plan on making it so in the future. I wanted to share this because it is personally one of my favorite animations I have done, even though it is quite small for the time being.
